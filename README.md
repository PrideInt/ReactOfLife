# React - Conway's Game of Life

In this repo, I've created a React app that runs Conway's Game of Life, displaying it onto a `<canvas>` element.

It is a fully responsive site that responds to window size changes, allowing the Game of Life to reset every time it does.

Refreshing the page additionally resets the game.
